* It's a single page responsive website.
* A Gmap was added at the very bottom of the site to show the location of the particular restaurant.
* The food menus are displayed maintaining category.
* Customer can leave their reveiw on the site

Tools used :
1.  VISUAL STUDIO-2013 (IDE).
2.  SQL Server 
3.  HTML (For the front end).
4.  CSS (Cascading style for all page).
5.  BOOTSTRAP (for designing purpose).
